# The VnV Toolkit Project:

VnV Toolkit is a C++ API and Runtime that can be used to add support for end-user verification and validation within scientific applications. 
The toolkit uses a performant MACRO based system and Plugin API to provide a number of features that will allow the USERS of the DEVELOPERS 
application to ANALYZE, VERIFY and VALIDATE the results produced by the given application. 

The VnV toolkit uses DATA extracted during the simulation to generate an interactive SIMULATION REPORT that summarizes the results of simulation.
The toolkit supports the full range of VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION PROCESSES:

Features include:
   – A Builtin Unit Testing Framework.
   – Function level Integration Testing (configurable at runtime by the end-user).  
   – Application level Integration Testing.
   – Provenance Tracking. 
   – Input file validation
   – Live Data Visualization using real simulation data. 
   – Performance Monitoring   
   – Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis
   – A Browser based Execution and Report Viewing GUI.  
 
The toolkit includes an extensive Browser based GUI for simulation design, execution and analysis: The features of the GUI include:

  - Input file GUI including live validation and autocomplete. 
  - Remote Execution using SSH.
  - A fully featured IDE built using Eclipse Theia. 
  - 3D visualization using Paraviewweb.
  - View Live Interactive Simulation reports
  - Supports multi-user  SAAS deployment using Docker.
